# Mailing list

If you'd like to know when more resources become available, you can sign up for [email notifications here](https://emailoctopus.com/lists/95c27296-f1d4-11e9-be00-06b4694bee2a/forms/subscribe).

I send out notifications when there are significant new resources available, such as new cheat sheets, new sets of challenges, and critical updates to the projects. I don't send emails often, and you can unsubscribe at any time.

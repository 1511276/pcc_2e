# Data Science Resources
{: .no_toc }

Data Science is one of the most popular areas of programming right now, and that makes sense. There's a lot of data available to work with, and the better we understand that data the more we can do with it.

*Python Crash Course* just scratches the surface of what you can do with Python in this field. If you'd like to go further with Python in Data Science, there are a large number of resouces available. I hope this helps you figure out where to go next, and if you have feedback about any of these recommendations please don't hesitate to reach out.

Note: Some of the resources mentioned in the [General Python Resources](../general_python/) have sections focused on data science. I won't repeat those resources here, but you should check them out.

## Books and Print Resources

### Fundamentals of Data Visualization, by [Claus O. Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke)

This first recommendation is non-technical, because working with data is more than just a technical endeavor. When we present data, we use it to tell a story. Even if you only work with raw data and someone else creates visualizations based on your work, you are still involved in using data to tell a story. And the stories we tell with data impact people's lives more and more all the time.

*Fundamentals of Data Visualization* is language-agnostic - there's no code in the book. Other texts mentioned here will show you how to change the colors in your visualizations; this text will tell you when and why to change the colors, and how that will impact the stories your data will tell.

You can read *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* through [O'Reilly's online platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920137733.do), or you can buy it from [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fundamentals-of-data-visualization-claus-o-wilke/1128580869) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Visualization-Informative-Compelling/dp/1492031089). You can also see all of the visualizations in the book, and an earlier draft of the text, at the [author's website](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).

### Python Data Science Handbook, by [Jake VanderPlas](https://twitter.com/jakevdp)

Jake VanderPlas has been involved in the Python data science and visualization community for a long time. He has given many talks, and contributed to a number of prominent open source libraries in this area. *Python Data Science Handbook* came out in December of 2016, but it's still receiving strong reviews. I haven't read the book, but I have attended many of Jake's talks and learned a great deal from following his work. This book covers common Python data science tools, loading and processing data, visualizing data, and getting started with machine learning. When I have time to do more reading, this is the first data science book I'll work through.

You can read *Python Data Science Handbook* through [O'Reilly's online platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034919.do), or you can buy it from [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/python-data-science-handbook-jake-vanderplas/1124463128?ean=9781491912058) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Science-Handbook-Essential/dp/1491912057/). You can also find the entire text online at [the author's site](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/).

### Python for Data Analysis, by [Wes McKinney](https://twitter.com/wesmckinn)

Wes McKinney is the creator of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org), a prominent Python library for loading and working with raw data. Wes knows pandas inside and out, so the information is accurate and reliable. There's some criticism that the material is dry and just like reading documentation, but if you like books better than documenation this book will probably be worthwhile. If you want to read a more detailed comparison between this book and *Python Data Science Handbook*, there's a nice writeup [here](http://sam-koblenski.blogspot.com/2019/02/tech-book-face-off-python-for-data.html).

You can read *Python for Data Analysis* through [O'Reilly's online platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920050896.do), or you can buy it from [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/python-for-data-analysis-wes-mckinney/1124074589) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/). You can also find the code for the book online at [github.com/wesm/pydata-book/](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book).

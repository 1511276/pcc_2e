# Data Science Resources
{: .no_toc }

Data Science is one of the most popular areas of programming right now, and that makes sense. There's a lot of data available to work with, and the better we understand that data the more we can do with it.

*Python Crash Course* just scratches the surface of what you can do with Python in this field. If you'd like to go further with Python in Data Science, there are a large number of resouces available. I hope this helps you figure out where to go next, and if you have feedback about any of these recommendations please don't hesitate to reach out.

Note: Some of the resources mentioned in the [General Python Resources](../general_python/) have sections focused on data science. I won't repeat those resources here, but you should check them out.

## Books and Print Resources

### Fundamentals of Data Visualization, by [Claus O. Wilke](https://twitter.com/ClausWilke)

This first recommendation is non-technical, because working with data is more than just a technical endeavor. When we present data, we use it to tell a story. Even if you only work with raw data and someone else creates visualizations based on your work, you are still involved in using data to tell a story. And the stories we tell with data impact people's lives more and more all the time.

*Fundamentals of Data Visualization* is language-agnostic - there's no code in the book. Other texts mentioned here will show you how to change the colors in your visualizations; this text will tell you when and why to change the colors, and how that will impact the stories your data will tell.

You can read *Fundamentals of Data Visualization* through [O'Reilly's online platform](), or you can buy it from [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fundamentals-of-data-visualization-claus-o-wilke/1128580869) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Data-Visualization-Informative-Compelling/dp/1492031089). You can also see all of the visualizations in the book, and an earlier draft of the text, at the [author's website](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/).

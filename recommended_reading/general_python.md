# General Python Resources
{: .no_toc }

The guiding principle for what to include in Python Crash Course was, "What's the least you need to know in order to begin working on meaningful projects?" The answer to that question became the first half of the book. It's a good approach that has allowed many people to go from knowing little or nothing about Python, to understanding how to approach larger projects.

If you know you want to get further into Python, however, there's a lot more you'll want to learn. You don't need to learn it all at once, but you should be aware of what there is to learn, and what resources might help you learn intermediate Python concepts and tools. This section will help you figure out how to learn more about Python.

You don't have to start here; many context-specific resources will introduce you to intermediate concepts while focusing on a specific context. Also, it's a great idea to just start building some projects based on what you've learned from Python Crash Course. The book covers just the basics, but there's a whole lot you can do with what you've already learned! Much of what's to come is just about doing this same kind of work more efficiently.

### Automate the Boring Stuff with Python, by [Al Sweigart](https://twitter.com/AlSweigart)

*Python Crash Course* and *Automate the Boring Stuff* are two of the most frequently recommended introductory Python books, and they are often recommended together. PCC builds a foundation in basic programming concepts and tools, and then jumps into a series of meaningful projects. ATBS introduces programming concepts and tools through a series of smaller projects that help people automate common tasks. PCC readers often follow up PCC with ATBS, to expand their understanding of how to apply Python to common tasks; ATBS readers often follow up ATBS with PCC to solidify their understanding of fundamental programming concepts, and to apply what they've learned to more in-depth projects.

There's a lot of overlap between these two books, but there's enough unique material in each book to make them quite worthwhile to read together. I have often found myself skimming sections of ATBS when I've had to work with PDFs, Word documents, and spreadsheets through Python for specific projects.

You can buy *Automate the Boring Stuff* [directly from No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/automatestuff2), through [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/automate-the-boring-stuff-with-python-2nd-edition-al-sweigart/1133598925?ean=9781593279929) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593279922/), and you can read [an online version](https://automatetheboringstuff.com) as well. If you buy direct from No Starch Press, e-versions of the book are included with the print version.

### Python Flash Cards, by Eric Matthes

No Starch Press publishes a set of [Scratch Coding Cards](https://nostarch.com/scratchcards3) for kids, and they asked if I'd develop a set of flash cards focusing on Python for learners of all ages. This was a really interesting project to work on; it's interesting to come up with meaningful bite-size chunks of Python to focus on.

The first group of cards covers *Concepts and Vocabulary*, to help you understand many of the essential terms that are thrown around regularly by programmers. The rest of the groups focus on specific kinds of syntax and tools, such as *Simple Data Types* and *Lists and Tuples*. You can see a table of contents for the entire set [here](https://nostarch.com/pythonflashcards).

The cards haven't made a strong impression online, but when I've spent time at the No Starch booth at PyCon many people bought a set after seeing the cards in person. Teachers have also been [enthusiastic about them](https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1117159862037700608), as there are a number of ways they can be used in the classroom. If you like working with offline learning materials at times and like your learning in bite-size chunks, you might like the flash cards. You can buy them direct from [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/pythonflashcards) or through [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/python-flash-cards-eric-matthes/1129141693?ean=9781593278960) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1593278969/). You can also see them in person at Barnes and Noble stores.

### Fluent Python, by [Luciano Ramlho](https://twitter.com/ramalhoorg)

I was very happy to see *Fluent Python* appear in print. Luciano Ramalho has been using Python for over 20 years, and he's spent much of that time helping people learn to use Python at all levels, for many different purposes. That puts him in a great position to share intermediate and advanced Python concepts, in a way that will help you use these concepts in your own projects.

*Fluent Python* is not just a reference book. It's meant to be read, and it's meant to help you develop a thorough understanding of how Python is best used to reprenset abstract and concrete real-world situations. Luciano doesn't just tell you how to do things with Python, he tells you why things should be done this way as well.

*Fluent Python* is closer to an advanced book than an intermediate book. It counts on you knowing basic and intermediate Python concepts, but it also expects you to have spent some time using Python in a variety of real-world projects. If you're not quite there yet, it's a great book to have in your library and work through over time. I haven't read much of it yet, but I eye it all the time and I'm really looking forward to making time to give it a proper reading. I'm sure it will make me a better Python programmer, and I appreciate Luciano for having put so much thought into how to present these concepts.

You can read *Fluent Python* through [O'Reilly's online platform](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032519.do), or you can buy it from [Barnes and Noble](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/fluent-python-luciano-ramalho/1124386594?ean=9781491946008) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Fluent-Python-Concise-Effective-Programming/dp/1491946008).

# Django Resources
{: .no_toc }

I am actively working on this section, and it should be out by the end of this week (5/29).

Note: Some of the resources mentioned in the [General Python Resources](../general_python/) have sections that are relevant to Django developers. I won't repeat those resources here, but you should check them out as well.

# Django Resources
{: .no_toc }

Django has been one of the most prominent Python web frameworks for almost 15 years now. Django is downloaded about 200,000 times each day, and powers millions of websites. You can use it for small projects where you're the only user, or for projects that just serve the teams you work with. But it's also powerful enough to serve some of the most popular sites on the internet such as Instagram, Pinterest, and Disqus.

You can use books to get started with Django, but once you learn the overall structure of Django projects and how to do common tasks, you'll want to become familiar with the official documenation and some other online resources. Django has some of the best documentation of any open source project, and it's well worth your time to become familiar wtih it. This section will help you find some good followup resources after working through the Learning Log project, and also familiarize you with resources you're likely to use as long as you're an active Django developer.

Note: Some of the resources mentioned in the [General Python Resources](../general_python/) have sections that are relevant to Django developers. I won't repeat those resources here, but you should check them out as well.

## The Official Django Tutorial (The Polls Tutorial)

The Django documentation includes an in-depth tutorial that's really worth going through. In fact, I highly recommend it as your next step after completing the Learning Log project. You'll be familiar wtih much of what you see, but you'll also learn more details about many aspects of Django, and see some new features as well. For example you'll see how to test your Django apps, which is absolutely critical for many webapp-based projects. The tutorial also has links to the technical documentation throughout, which is a great way to start exploring the technical documentation.

Almost everyone in the Django community has worked through the Polls tutorial at some point, and working through it gives you common ground in your early communication with other Django developers.

You can start with an [overview](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/) of all the parts of the tutorial, or you can straight to [part 1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/intro/tutorial01/). (When it tells you to install Django, it's a good idea to set up a virtual environment for the tutorial project just like we did in the Learning Log project. I would call it `pt_env`, for "polls tutorial environment." Also, when you've finished the tutorial you might try pushing the project to Heroku.)

## Books and Print Resources

### Django for Beginners, Django for APIs, and Django for Professionals, by [Will Vincent](https://twitter.com/wsv3000)

I haven't read any of thse books, but I've read many of Will Vincent's articles about specific topics in Django. Every article has been accurate and up to date, with clear instructions and explanations. I have no doubt his books are of the same quality. Will is also a board member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/), and he co-hosts the [Django Chat] podcast and co-curates the weekly [Django News](https://django-news.com) newsletter.

*Django for Beginners* walks you through building a series of increasingly complex websites using Django. *Django for APIs* shows you how to build web apps where Django is used for the backend and a JavaScript library (React in this case) is used for the frontend. *Django for Professionals* takes you from the tutorial-focused world to the real world by building a professional-quality project complete with support for payments through Stripe.

If you're interested in any of these books, you can see more about them and buy them at [learndjango.com](https://learndjango.com). There's a discount if you buy the three books as a bundle.

### Django Crash Course, by [Daniel Feldroy](https://twitter.com/pydanny/) and [Audrey Feldroy](https://twitter.com/audreyr)

Daniel and Audrey Feldroy are the authors of *Two Scoops of Django*, which focuses on more advanced aspects of Django. *Django Crash Course* (which has no affiliation with *Python Crash Course*) is their foray into introductory Django topics. *Django Crash Course* is based on materials that Daniel and Audrey have used for years in corporate training programs. They have repackaged their material to be accessible to anyone already familiar with Python, but not necessarily having a background in Django. They are planning a series of extensions to the book which will cover specific topics that build on the material in this book.

*Django Crash Course* is available now as an ebook. You can preorder a paperback, coil-bound, or hardbound copy as well. All of these versions are available [here](https://www.feldroy.com/products/django-crash-course).

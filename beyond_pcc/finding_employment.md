# Finding Employment as a (New) Programmer
{: .no_toc }

People often write to me and ask about getting a job as a programmer. When people write and ask for help with some part of the book, I often ask them what they want to do as a programmer. Often, their answer involves finding work as a programmer. In the [ongoing survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSez7B3mKB9hmOKoiE7LS5ZmpaWME_KNOiLsznH4zb0UtSoxsA/viewform?usp=sf_link) I have posted, just over half of the people who've responded say that one of their goals is to find employment as a professional programmer.

This post is a response to the many and varied questions I get asked about finding work as a programmer.

## My Perspective

If you're going to take career advice from someone, you should probably know a little about that person's career. I've spent most of my life teaching math and science to high school students. I've always enjoyed programming, and over the last 10 years or so I've used it in more and more professional contexts. Most of my focus is on producing high-quality learning resources, but I also keep my hands in a few professional projects. Some of my the programming-related projects I've been involved in include:

- Creating visual transcripts that help students, teachers, and parents know exactly how much progress students have made towards graduation.
- Quickly assess whether students are eligibile for extracurricular activities, with an emphasis on providing students support *before* they become ineligible.
- Mapping target and bycatch rates in the commercial fishing industry, to help reduce bycatch rates.
- Helping fishing boats avoid sperm whales, who have developed the ability to pick off every fish on a line as it's pulled onto the boat.

In short, I've used code in a variety of real-world contexts, both paid and unpaid. I've also read about the job-finding process in the tech world for a long time, because I've always considered jumping into full time tech work, and I want to know that I'm helping prepare people to find the jobs they're hoping to find. I know that a good number of people who start out learning with *Python Crash Course* have found jobs, because when I go to conferences a number of people at different vendor booths stop me to tell me that PCC started them on the path to finding employment in the tech world.



## What Employers are Looking For

If you're hoping to find work as a programmer, it's really important to understand what employers are looking for. They are *not* paying you to write code. They're paying you to use code to solve real-world problems. Understanding that one concept will take you a long way towards landing, and holding, your first programming job.

From years of working on tech-related projectts, reading about hiring from the employer's and job-seeker's perspectives, and participating on a number of hiring committees, I've come up with the following list of what employers are looking for:

- The ability to contribute in a team environment.
  - Good interpersonal skills
  - Knowing how to ask for help
  - Knowing how to give feedback
- The ability to use code to solve real-world problems.
  - Knowing one language well enough to build real-world projects.
  - Having a meaningful demo project.
  - Having transferable skills and understanding
- Domain experience and expertise.

### Contributing in a Team Environment

Many people still have the illusion that programmers can work in an isolated environment and just get paid to write code on their own computer, without having to deal much with others. That just isn't reality, and it really never was. Very few software projects are developed by a single programmer; almost everything meaningful is done as part of a team moving toward a common goal. Contributing in a team environment really means knowing how to show respect to others, and knowing how to respectfully share your own work. There are plenty of people with poor communication skills who mianage to hold onto their jobs, but if you're looking for a job yourself it sure helps to not be one of these people. And if you find yourself working in an environment where this is the dominant culture, the best way to get out is to avoid becoming one of these people and keep looking until you find a job with a healthier team.

## What can I do to make myself more hireable?

- Make respectful communication a priority if you don't already do so.
- Build a demonstration/ portfolio project.
    - Create an original real-world project.
    - Add non-trivial features to a tutorial project.
    - One well-thought out project is better than many partial projects.
    - Make sure your project includes a meaningful test suite.    
- Demonstrate proficiency with professional workflow tools.

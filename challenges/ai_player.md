# Challenges - Automated Alien Invasion Player
{: .no_toc }

In this investigation, you'll start out by writing a program that takes control of the Alien Invasion game, and then implements successively more effective strategies to reach a high score in the game.

The automated player is a lot more interesting to watch if your game has sound effects. You can see how to add sounds to your game here, if you'd like to do that before trying these challenges. Also, this can be a fairly complex challenge to get started on, so there's a guide that can help you if you're not sure how to approach the overall challenge.

I've had a lot of fun writing my own game mods related to this challenge, so if you make something interesting please share it!

### AI Player 1: Automated Player

Most people will probably need some help to get this started, but feel free to try it yourself before looking at the guide.

Write a program called *ai_player.py* that creates an instance of the `AlienInvasion` class. Your program should take control of the ship, and fire at aliens. You should be able to run *ai_player.py*, sit back, and watch your player shoot down aliens.

You can solve this challenge without making any changes to the code that was already written for the Alien Invasion project. All of the code necessary to automate the game can be written in a single *ai_player.py* file.

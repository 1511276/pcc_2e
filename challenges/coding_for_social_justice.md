# Coding for Social Justice
{: .no_toc }

## Overview
{: .no_toc }

As I wrote in [Coding is Political](/), learning to code gives you power. But what does that power look like? How do you begin to exercise that power?

A full answer to these kinds of questions is lengthy, and I intend to write about that in the near future. One kind of power is the ability to collect and analyze data independently, rather than relying on the work of others. Learning to work with social justice related data means you no longer have to take politicans and others in power at their word when they tell you what "the data" says. You can find the data, evalute it, analyze it, and present your own findings. This will help you decide who you can trust, and help you find a voice in speaking truth to power.

The challenges here begin at Chapter 2. You don't have to wait until you've finished the book in order to start applying what you've learned to social justice issues. You can use your interest in, and commitment to, social justice to solidfying your learning. Working through these kinds of exercises early in your learning process can also help you think about how you might use what you're learning about programming to address systemic issues at a personal, local, national, and international level.

I have written these exercises in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. Each exercise may not appear to relate directly to Black lives, but that's because Black people's lives are impacted by a wide range of systemic issues. For example, the US prison system disproportionally incarcerates Black people, even when controlled for type of crime committed. So there are exercises here that clearly relate to Black Lives, but also exercises that relate to a number of social issues that dispoportionally impact Black people's lives. Additionally, the Black Lives Matter movement began in the US, but it has since led to global protests and renewed efforts to reject the legacy of colonialism. Some of the exercises below focus on issues in the US, but most are phrased in a way that they can be used to dig into relevant issues in different communities around the globe.

You don't have to do every challenge in the set. If one challenge depends on completing a previous challenge, that is indicated in the challenge. Challenges are grouped by chapter, so you'll know when you can start on each one.

## About the Data
{: .no_toc }

When addressing social justice issues, there is rarely a nice, clean, official, trustworthy database to work from. People in power tend to want to hide or obscure data, particularly data that paints them in an unfavorable light. For that reason, people working in this area work from a variety of often crowdsourced data sets. Just because a data set is crowdsourced doesn't mean it's less reliable; a well-structured and sourced, transparent dataset can be more reliable than an officially produced dataset.

To support these exercises, I've identified a number of datasets that you can start working with. If you find this work meaningful, you'll probably want to find your own data sets to work with, especially for local work, and as new broader-scale projects emerge. When you're starting out, however, it can be helpful to not have to find your own data. There's a [separate page](../social_justice_datasets/) describing these data sets, and individual exercises below will focus on specific data sets from this small collection. Feel free to apply any of the exercises below to a data set you have identified in your own work.

## Exercises

## Chapter 2

In Chapter 2 we learn about variables, so here's a quick exercise to get you started.

### CSJ 2-1: Black Lives Matter

Think of a statement you would make about the Black Lives Matter movement. For example, if you were going to hold up a sign in a march or in a protest, what would your sign say?

Assign your message to a variable, and use a `print()` call to display your message.

## Chapter 3

Chapter 3 focuses on lists, so we'll do a series of exercises that collect information relevant to social justice issues. 

### CSJ 3-1: Know their Names

Store the names of victims of police brutality in a list. Print each person's name. Consider printing a message about each person as well.

Consider doing some research to learn the names of less well-known victims from your local area, in addtional to more broadly-known victims.

### CSJ 3-2: Helping Organizations

One of the reasons police violence is so entrenched is that the police are the first group called not just for acute threatening situations, but also for situations involving addiciton, domestic violence, mental health, and much more.

To help ground our thinking in what other resources we have available in our communities, make a list of several non-police organizations in your community that address any or all of these issues. Use the `print()` function to output the names of each of these organizations.

## Chapter 4

In Chapter 4, we learn to work more efficiently with lists. There are just a few exercises here because while we can do the work from Chapter 3 more efficiently, we can't add much to this.

### CSJ 4-1: Efficient Output

Take one or more of your Chapter 3 programs from this set of challenges, and replace your series of `print()` calls with a single loop. If you had different messages that can't be automated, consider writing a more general message that can be repeated for the entire list.

## Chapter 6

In Chapter 6, we learn about dictionaries. With dictionaries, we can really start to dig into social justice issues because we can begin to connect pieces of information. I encourage you to try these exercises, but don't get lost in large data sets at this point, because you'll learn to automate much of this work in later chapters.

### CSJ 6-1: Annual Incidents of US Police Killings

Visit the [National Trends](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/nationaltrends) page on [Mapping Police Violence](../social_justice_datasets#mapping_police_violence). Choose several years from the data shown, and make a dictionary where the keys are the years and the values are the number of people killed by police officers in the US for that year. Loop through your dictionary, and print a summary of how many people were killed for each year in your data set.

### CSJ 6-2: International Rates of Police Killings

To put things in perspective, it's helpful to know how the rates of police violence in the US compare to the rates of police violence in other nations. Wikipedia maintains a list of [international rates of killings by law enforcement officers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_incarceration_rate). Read through this list, and pick 5-10 countries to focus on.

Store your selected data in a dictionary, where the keys are the country names or abbreviations and the values are the rates of police violence in those countries. Use a loop to summarize your data about each country.

## Chapter 20

In Chapter 20, we learned to style and deploy a web app. Before you deploy a web app that addresses any systemic issue, please consider carefully the risk you are taking for yourself, and the risk you are asking others to take in using your project.

The Learning Log project barely scratches the surface of what it takes to build a functioning web app that's available to a worldwide audience. Web apps that address systemic issues can challenge those who hold power, but they can also expose vulnerable people to severe and immediate risk. Before deploying a project that focuses on this area, please carefully evaluate the risk to everyone involved, and consider finding more experienced people and groups to work with in building out your idea.
